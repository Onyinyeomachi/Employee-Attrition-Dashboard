# Business Introduction

TechSolutions is a leading technology company specializing in software development, IT consulting, and innovative technology solutions. With over 1,000 employees worldwide, TechSolutions prides itself on its cutting-edge technology, diverse talent pool, and commitment to employee growth and satisfaction.
However, in recent years, the company has faced challenges with employee retention, which has impacted productivity and increased hiring and training costs.


# Problem Statement

Employee attrition has become a significant concern for TechSolutions, with an increasing number of employees leaving the company within the first few years. The Human Resources (HR) department has observed a rising trend in voluntary departures, raising alarms about potential underlying issues affecting employee satisfaction and engagement. Understanding the factors contributing to attrition and developing strategies to improve employee retention has become a top priority for the company.


# Project Objectives

To analyze employee attrition trends and identify key factors contributing to employee turnove.

Attrition by Education Field:

Purpose: Determine if there are significant differences in attrition rates among employees with different educational backgrounds.


Attrition by Travel Frequency:

Purpose: To understand the impact of business travel frequency on employee retention.


Attrition by Gender:

Purpose: To analyze gender-specific retention issues.


Attrition by Job Satisfaction:

Purpose: To assess the correlation between job satisfaction levels and attrition rates.

Attrition by Age Group:

Purpose: To reveal age-related factors influencing employee departure.


# Here's a breakdown of My approach:

Draw.io  – I used this to map out the structure of my dashboard, defining key metrics, layout, and flow of data insights.

PowerPoint  – I refined the design by creating a visual prototype of the dashboard, ensuring a clear and engaging layout before building it.

Tableau  – I implemented the final dashboard, integrating actual data, applying filters, and generating insights to identify attrition patterns.


# Here are the key insights from the dashboard:

Attrition Rate: The company has an attrition rate of 16.36%, with 1,485 total employees.

Attrition by Gender: More males (156) have left the company compared to females (87).

Attrition by Travel Frequency: Employees who travel frequently (24.91%) and rarely (15.34%) have higher attrition compared to non-travelers (7.89%).

Attrition by Age Group: The highest attrition is in employees aged 30-35 (69 employees) and 24-29 (60 employees).

Attrition by Education Field: The highest attrition occurs in Life Sciences (89 employees) and Medical (66 employees) fields.

Attrition by Job Role & Satisfaction: Employees with lower job satisfaction (1-2 ratings) tend to leave more frequently.

# Conclusion
The dashboard suggests that younger employees (24-35 years), males, and those in Life Sciences/Medical fields have the highest attrition rates. Employees who travel frequently are more likely to leave, and job satisfaction plays a significant role in turnover.
